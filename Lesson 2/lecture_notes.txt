#Github
-  git add, git commit is on local repository
-  origin is alias for github repo
-  don't nest directories
    +  Need to be peers
    +  Can have folders though
    +  Web development needs its own repo/folder

#OOP
##Classes and Objects
-  Classes are cookie cutter, objects are the cookie
-  Classes contain behaviors
-  .new method is the initialize method
-  have to use .self, otherwise Ruby thinks it's a local variable
-  use the getter/setter to change the instance variable, don't change it directly
    +  But setter method has to use the instance variable

##Class variables and class methods
-  Class variables use @@
-  use self.method for class methods

##Inheritance
-  uses < operator to inherit from class
-  can override superclass methods
    +  method lookup chain
-  :: for calling classes that are in modules
-  for modules, reverse inclusion order - the last model included will be called first
-
